# FORESEE_velocity
1. The folder 'FORESEE_NCF' contains a total of 118 processed NCFs. The script `read_data.m` is used to read and display all NCFs.
2. The folder 'FORESEE_processing' contains Python scripts used to process the raw FORESEE DAS data to obtain NCFs.
3. The folder 'Vs_profile' contains the inverted Vs results. The script `Plot_Vs_profile.m` is used to visualize the Vs structure in 2D and 3D.  
4. The folder 'Rock_model' contains the computational process of the rock physics model. The script `Main1.m` serves as the main program.
5. The folder 'Modeling' contains the wavefield forward modeling codes of the three velocity models.
6. The file 'Support Information Movie S1.gif' is a rotational animation for the 3D velocity model.
